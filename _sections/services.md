                <h2>Consulting</h2>
            </header>
            <p>By working together I can help uncover pain points in your business processes as they relate to Magento and
            formulate a solution to make your company more efficient, secure, and reliable. I will develop a plan
            of action with a complete breakdown of recommended changes or additions to be made which can be revised or
            edited as needed. Then I put the plan into action and take your Magento based business to the next level, or
            guide your existing team to implement it with the highest standards.</p>

            </header>
            <p>As a certified developer in both Magento 1 and 2, whatever you need done, I can get it done. Whether you need a
            new payment integration, a code audit, Magento security patches installed, data restructuring, CRM or inventory
            integrations, etc, I've done it all. I can perform the work myself or fill the gaps in existing teams.</p>

                <h2>Leadership</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Do you already have a developer or developers on your team, but lack a senior figure to guide them? Or maybe
            you have an offshore team but lack the resources to perform code reviews and take ownership of the technical
            aspects of a project. I've lead multiple teams of both US and offshore based developers working closely with
            (and without in the case of smaller agencies) project managers and owners. If you're looking for a tech lead
            for a project, I've got the experience to lead your team to success.</p>
