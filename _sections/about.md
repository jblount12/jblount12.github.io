        <p>My name is <strong>Jason Blount</strong>. I started writing code as a hobby in 1998, and have been working 
        full time with Magento since early 2014. I've been fortunate enough to turn something I love into a profession, 
        and have a never-ending drive for continual self improvement. Writing good, clean, functional code is half 
        science, half art, and I take just as much pride in creating something amazing myself or working with a team to 
        really make something  incredible.</p>
        <p>I have vast experience in everything from support and maintenance to full builds and everything in between. 
        I've written full integrations between Magento and QuickBooks, integrations with multiple payment processors, as 
        well as countless modules, new features, data migrations, and modifications over the years. I've also worked
        with many clients to determine exactly what their needs are by taking a deep dive into their business processes
        and needs and working together to formulate and implement the best possible solutions.</p>
        <p>I've worked with some of the top Magento agencies as a senior developer, team lead, technical lead,
        architect, and mentor. I've also worked directly as a consultant with enterprise level clients. I'm certified in
        both Magento 1 and Magento 2 and I look forward to hearing from you and accomplishing something great together!</p>
