        <p>The <strong>Admin Multiship</strong> module is an extension developed for the Magento Marketplace. Once
            installed, it adds the ability to place multiship (multi-address) orders from Magento's admin panel. This is
            a project developed as a solo venture in order to fulfil a missing functionality in Magento. The extension
            is currently in the testing and finalization stages in order to be placed on the Magento Marketplace</p>

        <p>This module provides an entirely new section in the Admin. It is based on the core order creation interface,
            such that any modifications to the Magento order placement will also carry over to this module's placement
            page. The key difference is that the order creation process is split into multiple steps allowing the admin
            user to create multiple addresses for an order, each with its own order items. These addresses are shown in
            a sidebar allowing for easy review and modification. Once the orders are complete, a single payment is taken
            on a billing page, then all the orders are placed simultaneously.</p>

        <p>This extension ended up being over 3,000 lines of code over 50+ files. Key challenges included tracking and
            management of multiple quotes and tying them all together into one interface. This was done by using a
            database table and model to track multiship orders, and a joining table to connect multiship orders to
            quotes.</p>
        <p>The other major problem to overcome was to make the module agnostic to payment methods. That is, the module
            should be able to work with any payment method without having any knowledge of said method. This was
            accomplished by utilizing multishipping payment processor pools which payment methods could add their
            processors to via dependency injection, which is typically already done for payment methods supporting
            frontend multishipping. This allows any payment method to function without making any changes to the Admin
            Multiship module.</p>
