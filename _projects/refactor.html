        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This project started as a <strong>code audit</strong> performed for the client to see if there was anything
            that could be done to improve performance. I completed the audit, and in the process discovered that their
            data structure was the primary obstacle related to their performance issues. I proposed a full data
            restructure and code refactor, formulated a plan of action, then took the lead for all development, working
            together with a project manager to lead a team of certified developers and writing much of the code myself.
            This project was performed while working as an employee of a Magento Solutions Partner.</p>

        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>The client's business process had many unique needs which were not readily addressed from a stock Magento
            installation. Inventory management was unique, as was the structure of how products were managed as a whole.
            In addition, everything was connected to a desktop version of QuickBooks, and a previous development agency
            had modified Magento's product data to fit with QuickBooks. The result was a hyper-inflated database which
            would lock up frequently and grind the site to a halt.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>Product data was restructured from a custom solution to one that cleanly leveraged existing Magento product
            types. Doing so, however, required nearly all custom code to be refactored. Luckily, this provided us the
            opportunity to optimize the code and utilize caching to increase performance. Product data also had to be
            imported on a regular bases, as there were multiple sales channels and inventory had to be consolidated.
            This was done through custom-made endpoints and queries which would regularly import and reindex the
            data.</p>
        <p>As a result of this restructure, the integration with QuickBooks had to be rewritten. I performed this
            rewrite myself, and was able to create a module with full synchronization between Magento and QuickBooks. In
            order to accommodate for downtime on the QB server, I built a queueing system which would make note of all
            changes within the Magento data; including product creation/edits, order placements, inventory changes,
            etc. This data would be queued, then sent to QB once ready. Data was transformed to QB standards during
            synchronization rather that within the data as was previously done, allowing us to reduce the database size
            by tens of gigabytes and increase performance in all aspects of the website.</p>
