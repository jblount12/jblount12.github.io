        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This project was a full <strong>migration</strong> from Magento 1 to Magento 2. I was the
            <strong>technical lead</strong> for this project within a Magento Soltuions Partner, in charge of all
            aspects of backend development and code-related oversight. I worked together with a project manager and a
            lead frontend developer and directly managed a team of backend developers. I performed code reviews for all
            backend code and oversaw deployments as well.</p>

        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>Graeters already had an existing Magento 1 storefront with heavy customizations and both custom and
            commercial extensions. The Graeters team also used this opportunity to do a full site redesign. However, my
            task was backend related, so my primary focus was to work with my team on these aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Migrate all products, customers, and order data</li>
            <li>Transfer all custom functionality and features</li>
            <li>Optimize for best performance</li>
            <li>Utilize industry best practices to ensure security</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The largest hurdle faced was to be found in the custom shipping containers and order splitting logic used by
            the client. Due to selling perishable goods, products had to be shipped in specialty packages, with strict
            limits as to the qty, weight, and product types. These packages also needed to be split into multiple orders
            during checkout in order to be compatible with the client's internal processes. This was accomplished by
            creating an admin interface for packages where an administrator could specify the exact rules for each
            package and how it was to affect order splitting. We then created custom code which would split the order
            into appropriate order addresses by leveraging Magento's multi-address checkout system. We then also built
            the connections between these orders and the client's inventory management system by utilizing Magento's web
            API and adding our packaging data into that.</p>
        <p>The client also used a custom payment processor for their gift cards. For this, we wrote a new module
            integrating Magento with the processor, then replaced the core Magento gift card account functionality with
            our own custom classes which would, instead of using the internal database as Magento's default classes
            would, make calls out to the processor's API and utilize their data rather than store our own.</p>
